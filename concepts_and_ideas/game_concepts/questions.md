# Questions

There will 5 question categories: Comparing, Measuring, Radius, Thermometer and Photo questions.



## Comparing (Draw 3, Pick 1)
The Hider must compare some feature of their hiding spot to the Seekers.

Available Comparing Questions:
* Does my bus stop at your location?
* Does your bus stop have the same number of letters as mine?
* Are you on the same street/path as me (If Hider is not on a street, the clostest one is used)
* Are you in the same Bezirk as me
* Are you in the same Gemeinde as me



## Measuring (Draw 3, Pick 1)
The Hider must measure something.

Available Measuring Questions (rounded to 2 kilometers):
* How far to the next train station
* How far to the next mountain
* How far to the next mini golf course
* How far to the next museum



## Radar (Draw 2, Pick 1)
The Seekers choose a distance. The Hider must answer if they are within or outside of the range of the radar.

Available distances:
* 500m
* 1km
* 2km
* 5km
* 8km
* 15km
* 40km
* Choose your own



## Thermometer (Draw 2, Pick 1)
The Seekers choose a distance. They travel that distance and then ask the Hider whether they are closer or further away from them compared to the beginning. This effectively cuts the map into two parts.

Available distances:
* 750m
* 5km
* 15km



## Photo (Draw 1, Pick 1)
The Hider must send the Seekers a photo of something within 10 minutes unless specified otherwise. If they cannot take the photo within 10 minutes (because they are to far away to get there in time) or during the endgame, the Hider must tell the Seekers that they cannot take a photo.

* A tree (must include entire tree)
* Photo of Sky (Put Phone on Ground and shoot straight up)
* Selfie (Arm fully streched out, parallel to ground)
* Tallest Man-Made Structure (What looks like the tallest from your location. Must include Top and two sides of structure. A structure can be a building, but also an electricity pole, a tv mast, etc.)
* A building visible from your bus station (Can be any building. Must include Top and two sides of structure)
* Tallest Man-Made Building from Train station (What looks like the tallest from your location. Must include Top and two sides of structure)
* Two buildings (Must include 1.5*1.5 meter area with 3 distinct elements)
