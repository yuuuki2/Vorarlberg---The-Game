# Rules

## Start of Game
* Hider gets 1.5 hours hiding time from a central location (Dornbirn or Feldkirch Bahnhof for example).
* Can use public transport (Trains, Busses) or walk, but has to hide within 400 meters of a bus stop or train station.

## Hiding Zone
* This 400 meter zone is called the [`hiding zone`](#hiding-zone). 
* The hider may not leave the [`hiding zone`](#hiding-zone) during the game.
* The hider should search for a good hiding spot within his zone. The hiding spot should be within 5 meters of a marked path (a road, hiking route or similar).
* The hiding spot should be accessible 24 hours a day for free. For example, Wildpark Feldkirch is okay because it's free to enter and open 24/7. On the contrary something like a toilet stall, someones house or a supermarket are off limits.
* Once the [`endgame`](#endgame) starts, the hider has to enter this hiding spot, and may not leave it until found. This means that he cannot answer [`questions`](#questions) such as photo questions or questions that require him to move.

## Endgame
* The endgame is the end of the game ðŸ˜®
* It starts once the seekers enter your [`hiding zone`](#hiding-zone) and get off their transit option. It starts even if they don't know you are here. If they leave it again (by walking away/taking another bus or train) **the endgame continues and does not stop**. If they drive through your [`hiding zone`](#hiding-zone) but dont stop, **the endgame does not start**.
