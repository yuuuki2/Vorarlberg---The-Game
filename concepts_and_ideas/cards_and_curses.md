# Cards and Curses

There are three different types of cards: Time Bonuses, Power Ups and Curses.
The hider can hold 6 cards at a time unless expanding his card deck using a `Draw 1 Expand Deck by 1` Power Up.



## Time Bonuses

* 6 minutes (Amount: 15)
* 10 minutes (Amount: 10)
* 15 minutes (Amount: 3)

## Power Ups
Power Ups give the Hider extra power. They get put back in the deck when used.
Amount: 21

Types of Power Ups:
* Randomize (Amount: 4): When the Seekers ask a question, you can randomize it to another question instead. You will get the reward cards of that question instead.

* Duplicate (Amount: 2): You can duplicate another card.

## Curses
Curses can be used by the hider to slow down the seekers and distract them. Some Curses have a casting cost. This means that you need to do something or sacrifice some other cards to cast the curse.
